# perl_examples
Examples for Perl scripts and code


For the moment I will add here the examples that I would like to have created.

-Perl command line to do things without need to create a perl script
-File creation using the << that I have to search what it is
-Using class with perl
-Having reference files that can be used in perl to generate new files
-search more advanced perl actions with code

Need to improve the list
